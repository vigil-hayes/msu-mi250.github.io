topic: Version Control
parent: Week 3
---

From here on out, you'll be using something called version control to collaborate with partners in class and to turn in code. Version control allows programmers to keep track of changes to their code and to collaborate with other programmers more easily. The type of version control we'll be using is called Git. We'll be using it alongside Gitlab, which is kind of like Google Docs except specifically for storing code. Gitlab is where you'll turn in your code from now on.

**Note:** Some of these readings talk about Github, which we won't be using. We're using Gitlab instead. Gitlab and Github are two different variations on the same thing - they're run by different companies, but they do the same thing, which is allow people to store programming projects in the cloud. We use Gitlab for this class because MSU runs an MSU-specific Gitlab server that all students can use for free.

## Readings
Some of these readings get in the weeds about using Git - don't worry if you don't understand everything. We'll be practicing in class this week.

## Summary

When writing your summary this week, think about the kinds of tools you've used to collaborate with classmates in the past. What did you read about version control that sounded similar to other tools you've used? What was new to you about it?

**Summary prompt:** Why do we need version control? How is it different from how you've shared work with group members in the past?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on Thursday.
