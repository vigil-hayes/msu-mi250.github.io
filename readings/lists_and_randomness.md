topic: Lists and Randomness
parent: Week 6
---

This week we're learning about lists and revisiting the random module, which we started using a couple weeks ago. 

## Readings

### Lists

* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 4 - Lists](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/){:target="_blank"}
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Lists](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/lists.html){:target="_blank"}
* [Learn Python: Lists](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists){:target="_blank"} - practice.

### Randomness
* [Random Numbers in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-numbers-in-python/#){:target="_blank"} - this reading might look familiar. Does it make more sense this time around?
* [Python random module](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-random-module){:target="_blank"}

## Readings & Extra Exercises for Loops
Some of you mentioned that you would like some extra exercises and reading related to nested loops. 

## Extra Exercises for Turtle
If you found turtle to be helpful for your understanding, you might enjoy trying some additional exercises.

Here are some common exercises: 
* [Computer Science Cafe Turtle Exercises](https://www.computersciencecafe.com/turtle-challenges.html)
* [Oxford Turtle Self-Teaching Exercises](https://www.turtle.ox.ac.uk/downloads/docs/Turtle_Python_Exercises_1-12.pdf)


One extra challenging exercise would be to use turtle to draw more complex algorithms and data structures. For example, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAz46Z5curo) to see how turtle is used to visualize data structures. Try this extra challenging exercise for creating trees.

## Summary

For the summary this week, think about what we've done in class already. 

**Summary prompt:** Summarize your thoughts about lists, and about using randomness with lists. Focus on ways they would make what we've already done in class easier (or harder?).

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before the first class of the week.
