parent: Week 6
---

This week we're learning about lists and revisiting the random module, which we started using a couple weeks ago. 

## Readings

### Lists

* [Automate the Boring Stuff: Chapter 4 - Lists](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter4/){:target="_blank"}
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Lists](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/lists.html){:target="_blank"}
* [Learn Python: Lists](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists){:target="_blank"} - practice.

### Randomness
* [Random Numbers in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-numbers-in-python/#){:target="_blank"} - this reading might look familiar. Does it make more sense this time around?
* [Python random module](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-random-module){:target="_blank"}


## Summary

For the summary this week, think about what we've done in class already. 

**Summary prompt:** Summarize your thoughts about lists, and about using randomness with lists. Focus on ways they would make what we've already done in class easier (or harder?).

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before the first class of the week.


# Extra Practice
Some of you noted it would be helpful to have some extra space to practice on your own or in addition to what we do in course. I created a new page called [Extra]({%link extra.md%}) that has several exercises for you to try out. I will try to note which concepts are explored for each set of "extra" exercises.
