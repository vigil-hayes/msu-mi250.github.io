## Summary

When writing your summary of this week's reading, think about what you now know about programming based on the readings and based on your own experiences. There's probably a lot you don't fully understand right now, and that's okay! That's why you're in this class.

The summaries you write every week are a chance for you to reflect on what you're learning in the class, and on how what you're learning might relate to your life. Don't just summarize what you've read; think about (and write about) how the readings connect to you. 

Summaries should also be brief! Your summary should be at least 3 sentences and no more than one paragraph.

**Summary prompt:** Why might programming be useful for you to learn?

## Question

Normally, there won't be a question prompt. But since this is the first week I want to know what specific questions you have about the course.

**Question prompt:** After reading the syllabus, what is a question or concern you have about this class?

## Turn in

Turn in your summary + question by going to D2L -> Quizzes. This is Week 1. Please turn it in **before class starts on Thursday, August 28**. Morgan will read them all before class starts and answer the most pressing questions at the beginning of class.
