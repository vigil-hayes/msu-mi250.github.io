topic: Files 
parent: Week 10
---

This week we're dealing with files. Files are one way to make data persistent - to store data separately from the program, which the program can then access. Files can also be a useful way to separate content (data) from the workings of the program (code).

## Readings

* [Python File Operation](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/file-operation){:target="_blank"}
* [Think Python, Chapter 14: Files](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2015.html){:target="_blank"} -- Read through 14.4.  Stop at 14.5: Catching Exceptions

Also, please re-read (skim) the following readings about dictionaries:

* [Using dictionaries to store data as key-value pairs](http://www.compciv.org/guides/python/fundamentals/dictionaries-overview/){:target="_blank"}
* [Think Python, Chapter 11 - Dictionaries](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2012.html){:target="_blank"} -- skim up to "11.6 Memos"

## Summary

For this week's summary, think about what you already know about other ways of storing data in Python, like variables, lists, and dictionaries. How are files different?

**Summary prompt:** What kinds of data do you think might be useful to store in a file? Why would you want to use a file rather than storing data in a variable inside of a program?

## Question

As per usual, your question can be one of three types:
* *Confusion*: what didn't you understand in the readings?
* *Curiousity*: what do you want to know more about?
* *Connection*: how does this topic connect to your own experiences?

Submit your summary+question on D2L under Quizzes before class starts on Monday.
