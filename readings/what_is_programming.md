This week, we get starting with our first steps toward programming.  

Each week in this class, I will assign some readings and/or videos for you to read (watch).  This is the only homework
for this class, but it is very important that you do it.  We will not spend time in class discussing these readings;
instead we will assume that you know them and will spend the time in class practicing what you are learning.

For this week, please read and/or watch:
* [What is Computer Programming?](https://news.codecademy.com/what-is-computer-programming/)
* [Why Should We Teach Programming?](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/why-should-we-teach-programming-hint-its-not-to-learn-problem-solving/)

<!--
Additionally, get started with a communications tool that is really commonly used among programmers: **Slack**.
* [Sign up for the MI 250 Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mi-250/signup)
* Read [Slack 101](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101)
-->

After reading and/or watching the week's assignment, you need to write up what I am calling a "Summary + Question".
This has two parts (obviously :):

#### Summary
Sometimes, you will be asked to do an "open summary", where you summarize what you understand about the concept of the
week.   Other times, you will be asked to do a "guided summary" where I specifically give you a question or two and ask
you to answer them.  Either way, the summary should be more than one sentence long, but no longer than one-two
paragraphs.  Either way, this is your opportunity to really think about the topic for the week and try to wrap your
brain around it.  Don't quote from the readings; instead try to integrate across them and use your own words to explain
the concept.

For this week, we will do a guided summary.  I want you to summarize your thinking about these readings by answering the
question **"Why do I want to learn computer programming?"** Use the readings to help you think about this question, and
really give it some thought. It is easy to give a flip answer to this question like "so-and-so told me to", or "it will
help me get a job".  But that's not enough; many people tell you to take classes that you don't end up taking, and lots
of different things might be useful for jobs.  Why programming?  

#### Question

Second, I would like you to think carefully and ask a thoughful question about the readings.  That's right -- YOU ask
the question.  The instructor and the TA will read through these questions before class, and use them to help tailor the
class to the things that you are interested in and to help make sure that you are able to learn the things that you
found confusing.

There are three types of questions that you can ask (though you only have to ask one question):
* A *confusion* question asks about something that you are still confused about even after reading and watching the
assigned material. It can be confusion about a specific point or a more general confusion about the topic overall.
* A *curiousity* question asks about something that makes you want to learn more about. The readings and/or videos may
have gotten you to think about something else that is related, but not really discussed in the material that you don't
understand; that is, it got you to be curious about something else.  This is a great chance to express that curiousity.  
* A *connection* isn't a question; instead, it is an example that applies the concept that your are learning to some
other aspect of your life or some other interesting thing in the world. 

After reading the material, come up with one question; it can be of any of these three types.

The question+summary can be submitted on D2L
