No new material will be covered today.

As an incentive to attend class on Tuesday before Thanksgiving, I will be giving a bonus final project consultation for those who attend class. This will be a chance to consult on your final project concept and plans and get one-on-one clarification on any questions. Bring any of your brainstorming materials, notes, starts at code...anything you might be using on your project. I would be happy to give you feedback.
