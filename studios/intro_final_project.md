At this point, we have covered almost all of the coding skills you will need to implement your final project. Your final project is non-trivial and something you should be starting NOW. 

In that vein, we are going to focus on getting started in class today.

For this class, there is no prior PMP due, but instead, we will review the final project together and form final project teams and have you start working on a PMP in-class.

**More instructions to come!**
