# All Studios require Project Management Components

Project management requires a wide range of components that involve team management (who is responsibile for what), time management (what will be delivered when and how long will it take), as well as software design. 

Every Studio assignment will require you to create the following components prior to class:

## Program Contract: WHAT needs to be done
Most programming work is broken up into different parts, which are usually done by different people.   The first part is
the *specification*: deciding what the program needs to do.  Specifications are hard because they need to provide enough
detail about what the program will need to do that someone else can program.  The second part is the *implementation*,
which is writing the main code that (hopefully) accomplishes what the specification says it should   The third part is
the *testing*, which checks the main code to see what it does and does not do, to make sure that it accomplishes what it
is supposed to do.

Prior to coming to class on Studio days, you will be required to submit a written specification and testing plan to D2L. Class time will focus on implementation.

1. First, you are going to need to write a specification.  What should the program look like? What functionality should exist to address the Studio problem description? How are you planning to implement this? Are there particular functions you need? Modules? Variables? Sections of code? Who will be responsible for implementing which parts and who will be responsible for being the navigator for which parts? If you would like, you can create pseudo code that helps outline this specification prior to coming to class to work on implementation

2. Second, you will write a testing plan. The testing plan will provide a comprehensive set of scenarios (perhaps input values) that demonstrate that your code works robustly. Working for expected input is great, but handling unexpected input is critical, too. Your test plan should describe different scenarios for how your code might be used and how you will test those scenarios using particular inputs and what the expected outcomes of those tests are.


### Advice

#### Be Detailed and Specific

The specification is your contract; it tells the other team what you want done.  The more specific you can be, the more
likely you are to actually get what you want.  If you are doing flashcards, Don't just say "do some math problems" --
how will they ever know what that means? If you just say "do some math problems", then they might give you back
flashcards for grade school math (2+2=4), or they might give you back calculus problems.  Which one die you want?
Instead, give them exact problems for the flashcards.  Tell them exactly how many flashcards.  Think about how you would
implement it, and give them some structure that they can use to make it work correctly.  Do you want it to count the
number correct?  Do you want it to be serious and boring, or snarky and funny?  Be specific.

#### Specify both program and content

The natural impulse is just to write the content (e.g. for the flashcards -- what questions should it ask, and what
should the answers be?)   But that's not enough.  You are asking them to write a computer program.   Be sure to also
specify what that program should do.  Should it be graphical (turtle) or text-based (terminal)?  Should it be case
senstive?  Should it give the user more than one chance to get it right?  Should it count the number correct?  What else
should it do?  Anything it should NOT do?

#### Think About Testing While Writing the Specification

Near the end of class, you are going to get back some code.  It almost certainly will not do exactly what you expect it
to -- but your partner will think it does.   Think about how you will test it.  As you are writing the
specification, also jot down some notes about how to test it.  What things will you look for? What does it mean to
"work" correctly?   What are some possible inputs, and what would you expect to happen with those inputs?

#### Communicate with your team
Everyone should be involved with developing the specification and testing plan.
