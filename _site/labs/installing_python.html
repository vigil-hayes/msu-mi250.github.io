with our first programming lab. We’ll be getting Python set up and getting your computer ready for writing code, then we’ll practice working with code a bit.</p> <h2 id="pair-programming"> <a href="#pair-programming" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="pair-programming"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Pair Programming </h2> <p>In this class, all of the labs will be done through pair programming. You will be assigned to work with one other person as a “pair”. Pairs work following the mantra of “2 people, 1 computer”; that is, both people work together on a single computer to get the lab exercises done. You must do all of the lab exercises together.</p> <p>You’ll be randomly assigned into a pair for each lab. At any given time, each of you will have different roles. One person will be the “driver”, and the other person the “navigator”. Once you’re paired up, begin by deciding who will be the driver and who will be the navigator.</p> <h3 id="driver"> <a href="#driver" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="driver"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Driver </h3> <p>The driver controls the computer. They are physically in front of their computer using the keyboard and mouse. The job of the driver is to get the computer to do the tasks assigned in the lab. The driver is ultimately responsible for what happens on the computer.</p> <h3 id="navigator"> <a href="#navigator" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="navigator"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Navigator </h3> <p>The navigator (also called the observer) watches the driver’s activities. They make suggestions, point out errors and problems, ask questions, and think more carefully about what is being done. Being a navigator does not mean being passive; you should be actively watching and trying to help out. Since laptop screens are small, it may be helpful if the navigator uses their laptop or another device to keep the lab instructions up or to look things up.</p> <p>It is very important that both members of the pair communicate regularly. The driver can ask questions and discuss issues, the navigator can ask that specific changes be made or specific code by typed in, and both members can stop what is going on to discuss anything they feel needs to be discussed.</p> <p>Periodically, both of you will switch roles. In some labs, we will switch roles when you complete specific parts of the lab (like today). In other labs, we will set times, and we will switch roles every 20 minutes or so. Everyone should be both a driver and a navigator at some point during the lab.</p> <h2 id="get-ready-to-work-with-python"> <a href="#get-ready-to-work-with-python" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="get-ready-to-work-with-python"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Get ready to work with Python </h2> <p>The goal of this lab is to get everything set up to run your first Python program on both your own computer and your partner’s computer. I will give you a program, and you can both run it on your computers.</p> <p>For this section, the driver will do everything on their computer first with the other person acting as navigator. Later on in the lab you’ll switch places. Remember you’ll figure things out faster by working together!</p> <p>And remember that Shiyu and Morgan are here to help - don’t be afraid to raise your hand if you get stuck!</p> <h3 id="install-python"> <a href="#install-python" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="install-python"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Install Python </h3> <p>Python is a programming language, but is interpreted, which means that there is a separate program that reads the program that you write and “runs” it by interpreting it as instructions. That is, it is a program that runs other programs.</p> <p>The first thing we need to do is go install Python. Go to the main Python website at <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>. On that page, hover over the “Download” menu and you should see a button with Python 3.13.X on it. Click the button to download the program, and run the installer program. That will install the current version of the Python interpreter on your computer.</p> <p><strong>Important for Windows:</strong> While running the installer, be sure to click the “Add python to the PATH” checkbox on the first screen.</p> <p>If you already have Python installed on your computer, make sure you have the current version (3.13.X).

The repository contains the code for this week’s lab. Each week’s lab will have a Gitlab link at the top.</p> <p>When you go to Gitlab for the first time, you’ll need to log in. Click the “Okta” button (and check the “Remember me” box down below so you won’t have to log in everytime.) If you’re logged into an MSU system already, the site should load. Otherwise, it’ll ask you for your MSU netid and password.</p> <p>Once you’re in Gitlab, you should see a short list of files. Clicking on a file will show you the contents of the file. This repository only has two files in it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> and a file called README.md which says a bit about what’s in the repository.</p> <p>We want to download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> file. Click on the name of the file, and it should take you to a page where you can view the file. Near the top of the contents, there is a download link that looks like the bottom half of a box with a down arrow going into it. Click that, and download the file. It will either automatically go to the Downloads folder on your computer, or it will ask you where you want to download it to.</p> <h3 id="find-the-program-using-command-line"> <a href="#find-the-program-using-command-line" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="find-the-program-using-command-line"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Find the program using command line </h3> <p>Next, we want to run the file from the command line. Open up PowerShell (in Windows) or Terminal (in Mac OS).</p> <p>The most important thing to remember about command line is that it only will let you do things with files if it thinks it’s in the same location the file is. That means it has to be in the Downloads folder to interact with any of the files in Downloads. PowerShell (Windows) will show you the directory tree you’re in, while Terminal (Mac) will only show you your current folder.</p> <p>By default, both PowerShell and Terminal start in the top level Users/username directory when you open it up. Other directories like Desktop and Downloads are nested directly under the Users directory.</p> <p>The first thing we need to do is to change the current directory to the one where the file was downloaded. If you sent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> to the Downloads folder, use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd downloads</code>. The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> is short for “change directory”. If that command works, it won’t print anything out; instead it will just give you a new prompt which will show you you’ve moved into that folder.</p> <p>On Windows, this looks like:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>PS C:\Users\geier\downloads&gt;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>On Mac, it looks like:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>geier-Macbook-Pro:Downloads geier$
</code></pre></div></div> <p>See how “downloads” is now in the prompt? You can always see where you are in the folder structure on your computer by looking at the command line prompt.</p> <p>You can go to different places on your computer, too. For example, if you created an “MI 250” folder on your desktop and saved <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> in there, you can get to your MI 250 folder in command line with this command:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd desktop/"MI 250"
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that whenever you have spaces in the name of a folder, you need to put quote marks (“”) around it when you navigate to it in command line.</p> <p>Once you think you’re in the right folder on command line, run the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. This will give you a list of files in that folder. Make sure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> is in that list. If it is, you can run it!</p> <h4 id="command-line-reference"> <a href="#command-line-reference" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="command-line-reference"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Command line reference </h4> <p>There’s also a neat trick that works in both Windows and Mac OS to get to the folder you want to go to.</p> <ol> <li>Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> in command line - make sure there is a space after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>.</li> <li>Open up the folder you want in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac OS) – the normal way of viewing folders.</li> <li>Drag the folder over to the command line window. When you release your mouse on top of the command line window, that should put the full directory name for that folder after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>. Then hit enter!</li> </ol> <p>A couple of other useful command line commands:</p> <ul> <li>You can get a list of the files in the current directory with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command</li> <li>You can move up one directory (to the parent directory) with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd ..</code></li> <li>If you start typing the name of a file or directory, you can hit the Tab key and it will try to automatically finish typing the name of that file/directory for you.</li> <li>When the space next to the prompt is empty (you haven’t typed anything yet), you can hit the “up” arrow on your keyboard - this will autopopulate the last command that was given.</li> </ul> <p>There’s more <a href="/reference/command_line.html">useful command line stuff</a> in the Reference section on this site.</p> <h3 id="run-the-program"> <a href="#run-the-program" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="run-the-program"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Run the program </h3> <p>Once you are in the right directory, try to run the Eliza program you downloaded:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python eliza.py

Play around with it, and answer some questions. Notice how it responds, and when it says the same things and when it says different things. When you are done, type “goodbye” to exit the program.</p> <p>Congrats! You have run your first python program by hand on the command line! Good work. We will be doing this many times over the course of the semester, but in the future it will mostly be programs that YOU write that you will be running.</p> <h2 id="trade-places-and-repeat"> <a href="#trade-places-and-repeat" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="trade-places-and-repeat"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Trade places and repeat </h2> <p><strong>Change Drivers</strong>: At this point, the driver should have Python installed and running on their computer, and should have been able to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code>. Now the driver and navigator should swap.</p> <p>Go back to the beginning of the <a href="#install-python">Install Python section</a> on this page and re-do these all of the above steps on the new driver’s computer. Make sure that you’ve got Python installed correctly on both computers, and that both computers can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code>. Some things will be easier the second time around, and sometimes you will encounter new problems. Work together with your partner to figure out how to get it working.</p> <h2 id="edit-the-program"> <a href="#edit-the-program" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="edit-the-program"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Edit the program </h2> <p>Congratulations on getting a Python program running on your computer. That is a big accomplishment, and is probably one of the hardest parts of this class. Command line, Python, downloading .py programs – this is all very weird and not the normal way we install or run programs on computers. There is a reason we do it this way – it turns out it will be easier in the future if we do it this way – but it is very weird and takes a while to get used to. That’s OK if it feels weird! It should.</p> <p>For the next step, we are going to edit the program. We are going to add some new features to the program, and then run it again.</p> <h3 id="install-a-text-editor"> <a href="#install-a-text-editor" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="install-a-text-editor"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Install a text editor </h3> <p>To edit the program, the first thing we need it is a text editor. Computer programs are written as plain text files. This means we can’t open them up in Word or Google docs or similar programs. We have to open them in a text editor. There are lots of text editors out there that you can use, and they can get really complicated.</p> <p>The text editor I recommend for this course is:</p> <p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a></p> <p>VS Code works for both MacOS and Windows. It’s entirely free. Here are a couple other free options, if you decide you don’t like VS Code:</p> <ul> <li>For Mac: <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html">BBEdit</a> (free version works fine)</li> <li>For Windows: <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a>.</li> </ul> <p>You are welcome to install any other text editor you like. If you have a text editor that you already use and like, that’s fine, too.</p> <p>All of the options above are free to use. There are many others, including some specifically for Python, but not all of them are free and some get very complicated. I encourage you to experiment and find one that YOU like. Programming is a form of art, and each artist has their own preferences for tools.</p> <h3 id="look-at-the-eliza-programs-code"> <a href="#look-at-the-eliza-programs-code" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="look-at-the-eliza-programs-code"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Look at the Eliza program’s code </h3> <p>You downloaded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> program earlier in this lab. Our next goal is to edit this file. Go to the text editor that you choose, and open the eliza.py file from whatever folder you downloaded it to (probably downloads).</p> <p>First, look over the file. Read what it says. It is weird, and hard to read. The file roughly has three sections.</p> <p>The first section is only 2 lines. It looks like a header (basically, it is). Both lines start with the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code>. We’ll learn more about imports later, but they allow the program to access specific functionality.</p> <p>The second section is labeled “list of inputs and possible responses”, and has a bunch of text in quotes. This contains the logic and intelligence for Eliza, our fictional person.</p> <p>The last section calls itself the “code that asks for user input and prints out a response”. This is a series of commands – think of them like the instructions you wrote to make pizzas earlier this week. It prints out information, then asks the user to type something in, and then chooses a response based on what was typed.</p> <p>Right now, the way Eliza works is that the computer looks for specific words in what the user types: words like “hello”, “mother”, or “I feel”, which the program calls prompts. Then, when it sees one of these prompts, it looks at the list of possible responses below the prompt, and picks one randomly to print out. So if the user enters “hello”, then it will randomly pick one of the 3 responses below it and print it out.</p> <h3 id="make-a-change-to-the-code"> <a href="#make-a-change-to-the-code" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="make-a-change-to-the-code"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Make a change to the code </h3> <p>We are going to make a change. We are going to allow Eliza to respond to questions.</p> <p>First, we should check whether she already does that. Run the eliza.py program with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python eliza.py</code> in command line. Enter a question, complete with a question mark at the end. What happens? She responds, but she doesn’t seem to acknowledge that it was a question.</p> <p>Now, let’s add an ability for her to respond to questions. If you look in the file, you should see code that looks like this:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> ("",
     ["Please tell me more",
      "Can you elaborate on that?",
      "I see",
      "How does that make you feel?",
      "How do you feel when you say that?"
     ]),
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That is the ‘default’ response; if she doesn’t know what else to say, she says that. Let’s put the question responses just above that. Add a new, blank line right <strong>above</strong> that. Then paste in this code:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  ("?",
     ["Why do you ask that?",
      "Why don't you tell me?"
     ]),
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Make sure not to leave out any parentheses (), square brackets [], or commas. Also make sure the indents look like how the next chunk of code is indented. Indents are important in Python.</p> <p>Great! You’ve just made your first changes to a Python program. Good work.</p> <p>When you’re done, save the file by going to File -&gt; Save in your text editor. A quicker way to do this is Ctrl+S on Windows or Cmd+S on Mac. Files never save automatically; you have to remember to do it yourself every time. If your changes aren’t saved and you try to run the program, it will run the last saved version.</p> <h3 id="run-again-and-see-if-the-changes-appear"> <a href="#run-again-and-see-if-the-changes-appear" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="run-again-and-see-if-the-changes-appear"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Run again, and see if the changes appear </h3> <p>Now let’s see if your changes work. Go to the command line again, and run eliza.py using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python eliza.py</code>. Notice that this is how we always run a Python program: we go to the command line, type the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code> followed by the name of the program file we’ve been editing. (And again, remember to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3</code> if you’re on a Mac!)</p> <p>Eliza should appear again. Start interacting with her. Does she still behave normally? What happens now if you ask her a question? Does she do something different than what she did before?</p> <p>If she does, then your changes have worked! If she doesn’t, then go back to the file and try again. Make sure you saved the latest version, and take a look at the punctuation and indents in the code you added.</p> <p>Don’t worry (yet) about how that code works, or what exactly it does. We will learn that throughout the semester. By the end of the semester – actually, about half way through the semester – you should be able to read and understand (and possibly write) this program yourself. But for now, if you don’t understand it, that’s normal and OK. The important part is figuring out how to edit files in a text editor, and then run them on the command line.</p> <h3 id="take-a-screenshot"> <a href="#take-a-screenshot" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="take-a-screenshot"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Take a screenshot </h3> <p>Once you’ve got the changes you made to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eliza.py</code> working, take a take a screen shot of Eliza working on your computer – preferably showing some of the new responses you’ve added – and submit it on D2L. The easiest way to do this is to put the window with your code editor and the window for Terminal or PowerShell side by side and take one big screenshot of both windows.</p> <h2 id="trade-places-and-repeat-1"> <a href="#trade-places-and-repeat-1" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="trade-places-and-repeat-1"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Trade places and repeat </h2> <p>In normal labs after this week, we won’t be repeating steps on both people’s computers. But for now, we want to make sure that both people’s computers are set up and working with Python correctly. So <strong>change drivers</strong> again, and go through the steps starting at <a href="#install-a-text-editor">Install a Text Editor</a> again on the other person’s computer. Hopefully it will be easier the second time around.</p> <h2 id="extra-challenges"> <a href="#extra-challenges" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="extra-challenges"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Extra Challenges </h2> <p>At this point, both you and your partner should have Eliza.py with changes working on both of your computers. Labs every week will have one or more challenges at the end. If you finish all of the main exercises, start working on one of the challenges. If you finish one (or both!) challenges before class ends, let Morgan know so I can check your work and answer any questions.</p> <h3 id="challenge-1-other-python-programs"> <a href="#challenge-1-other-python-programs" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="challenge-1-other-python-programs"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Challenge 1: Other Python programs </h3> <p>Now that you’ve gotten your first Python program running, try to download a few more Python programs and get them running. Be sure to run them using the command line:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/turtle-snowflakes/blob/master/code/snowflake.py" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> – draws a snowflake on the screen.

You will later in the semester. But still, it is a good exercise to try to add additional responses to Eliza. Try to figure out how she works, and see if you can get her to respond in different ways than she does now.</p> <h2 id="submit-your-work"> <a href="#submit-your-work" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="submit-your-work"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Submit your work </h2> <p>When you and your partner are done for the day, submit your work! Today you’ll just need to turn in screenshots to D2L of Eliza working in command line and of the changes you made to the code. If you got to the challenges, take screenshots of those working, too. Next week you’ll start turning in your code as well.</p> <p>If you and your partner both finished everything and submitted your work before the end of class, you can leave early! <strong>Make sure you check in with Morgan or Shiyu first.</strong></p> <p>If you didn’t get everything done today, that’s okay. Sometimes you won’t be able to finish the entire lab, and that’s fine. For today, since we were installing stuff you’ll be using for the rest of the semester, let Morgan or Shiyu know if you couldn’t finish the main part of the lab and how far you got. We’ll work with you after class or next week to make sure you have everything working.</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
