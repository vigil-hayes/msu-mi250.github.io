This is a short research and writing assignment. The purpose of this assignment is for you to think closely about an ethical issue related to programming (and more broadly, to technology). You'll read an article, then write 2-3 paragraphs in response to prompts about the article.

## Instructions

Choose one of the articles below to read. If you would prefer to find a different article to write about that follows the theme of ethics and technology and is of personal interest to you, that's fine, too. Make sure to indicate which article you're responding to at the top of your assignment.

Next, write a 2-3 paragraph reflection about the article you've chosen to read. Your reflection should contain:

1. The title of the article you read. (If it isn't one of the articles above, also include a link to the article.)

2. Summarize: write 1 paragraph describing the ethical issue the article talks about, in your words.

3. Reflect: write 1-2 paragraphs reflecting on the article. Specifically, think about the issue in terms of programming and design: what decisions were made in the creation of the technology (or in the marketing or use of the technology) that led to the issue(s)? What, if anything, do you think could be done to address the issue? When thinking about systems or technologies you might be involved with working on in the future, how might thinking about the possible costs of the technology affect how you approach your work?

Note: these are hard questions to answer, and there's no right answer. Don't feel like you have to answer them definitively. You may do more research into the issue if you wish, but it's not required. The goal of the assignment is to get you to think more deeply about the potential consequences of technology and to put into words what you think about it.

## Turn in

Turn in your reflection in on D2L either as a Word doc or a PDF under Assignments -> Ethics and Programming. This assignment at the end of the day on Wednesday in Week 13.
