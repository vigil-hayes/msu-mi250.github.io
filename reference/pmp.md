For most studios, you will need to turn in a Project Management Plan. You can find the PMP resources on GitLab [here](https://gitlab.msu.edu/mi-250/mi250-pmp-resources).

Please review every file in this repository carefully, particularly the README and pmp_example.md. 

Note that a link to a repository containing your PMP markdown file AND where your studio code will be is due BEFORE we work on a studio in class on D2L. For Weeks 3-6, the header information and Sections 1-4 of the PMP should be filled out **prior** to the in-class studio. For Weeks 7-12, Sections 1-5 of the PMP should be filled out **prior** to the in-class studio.

When your studio is due, I also expect to see a completed _Reflection_ section of the PMP in the GitLab repository as well as progress on the Kanban board.
